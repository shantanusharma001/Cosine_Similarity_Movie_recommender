# Cosine_Similarity_Movie_recommender
Movie recommender that uses cosine similarity to recommend similar movies based on plot descriptions. Furthermore, there is also a streamlit front end. 

Note to run the project please unzip the archive file which contains the TMBD database of 5000 movies and credits for these movies. After running the Jupyter Notebook you will have created a pickle dump and a numpy dump of teh dataframes required for the front end which will then be read by app.py and create a streamlit front-end. 

To run the streamlit app plaese type "streamlit run app.py"
